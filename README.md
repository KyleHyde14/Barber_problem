# Barber_problem
Imagine a hypothetical barbershop with one barber, one barber chair, and a waiting room with n chairs (n may be 0) for waiting customers. The following rules apply:

- If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep in the chair
- A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep
- If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are occupied and sits in an empty chair if it's available
- When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none
